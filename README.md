# Introduction
AS a database developer we normalize and denormalize database to organize a given database efficiently. It is a systematic approach to decompose a larger dataset into smaller ones that would  help us in from data redundancy.


According to wikipidea 
"Database normalization is the process of structuring a relational database in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. It was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd as part of his relational model."
