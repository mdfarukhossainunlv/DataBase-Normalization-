# Introduction
AS a database developer we normalize and denormalize database to organize a given database efficiently. It is a systematic approach to decompose a larger dataset into smaller ones that would  help us in from data redundancy.


According to wikipidea 
"Database normalization is the process of structuring a relational database in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. It was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd as part of his relational model."


# Database Normalization
The following database normalization process are widely used for normalization,

-First Normal Form (1NF)
-Second Normal Form (2NF)
-Third Normal Form (3NF)
-Boyce-Codd Normal Form or Fourth Normal Form (BCNF of 4NF)
-Fifth Normal Form (5NF)
-Sixth Normal Form (6NF)

In this article, we will only focus on the the concepts of 1NF, 2NF and 3NF, and 
First Normal Form (1NF)
Data is stored in tables with rows that can be uniquely identified by a Primary Key.
Data within each table is stored in individual columns in its most reduced form
There are no repeating groups
